        <p>
          When the Course of human events, it  <strong>becomes necessary</strong>
          for one people in dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,
          and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station 
          to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect 
          to opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impl 
          them to the separation. Perchance.
