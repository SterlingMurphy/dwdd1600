            Our Story
        </h1>

        <p>
            it was a dark and stomy night! than the creator Angelo made some soop and it tasted really good so he opened up a store. The store was great till a dragon went there to eat there, he ate up the whole invintory and even some of the workers.
            <br>
            How did Angelo come back?
            <br>
            Angelo went off and killed the dragon and all its eggs. So now that the dragons where all gone he reopened and its still better than your moms cooking till today!
            <br>
            Founded in 1782 BC. Angelo still is really good at cooking.
